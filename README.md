Parikh sets of strings


Parikh vector of a string:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parikh%27s_theorem

Parikh set of length k (denoted by Pi_k) of a string is a set that contains the Parikh vectors for all k-sized
substrings of the string.

>Consider the following example:
given s = aaba, then pi_1 = {(1, 0), (0, 1)}, pi_2 = {(2, 0), (1, 1)}, pi_3 = {(2, 1)}, pi_4 = {(3, 1)}.
